# Introduction

Welcome to the Super-Dimensional-Acquistion (SDA) documentation! With SDA you can control your microscope programatically with MATLAB. SDA is powered by and made possible by Micro-Manager, the open-source software by [Open Imaging](https://open-imaging.com/). SDA is part of the p53-Cinema project developed by the [Lahav Lab](http://lahav.med.harvard.edu/).
